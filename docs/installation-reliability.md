# Installation and socket recovery safety

## Contracts

`proxy/takeover.py` is the shared Linux socket supervisor/state helper used by
`extend.sh`, `restore.sh`, and the canonical `fnmusic-ext.service` template.
The scripts explicitly invoke Bash/Python, including with a 0644 checkout.

* Official identity requires Linux `SO_PEERCRED` and a `/proc/<pid>/exe` basename
  of `trim-music`. PID, process start time, executable, device and inode are
  recorded. Business responses such as `INVALID TOKEN` are never identity.
* Proxy identity requires HTTP 200 JSON from `/_ext/livez`, with
  `service: "fnmusic-ext"` and `pid` equal to the connected kernel peer PID.
* Readiness additionally requires the recorded proxy inode/process and
  `/_ext/healthz` with `ok: true`, `upstream: "ok"`. Each request allows 4 seconds
  (the app readiness budget is approximately 2.5 seconds). The helper uses a
  monotonic overall deadline, including connection/read time. Source curl loops
  likewise have an outer GNU `timeout`, with 4-second individual requests.

## Startup and shutdown

The project `.venv-proxy/bin/python -m uvicorn` is mandatory: no global fallback.
Dotenv is parsed as quoted data by the supervisor, not executed as shell.
A temporary-home import preflight redirects all known proxy storage paths and
DB/socket paths; bytecode writes are disabled. Numeric/import errors fail before
moving any socket. The real child first binds a private staging socket. Only after
its liveness PID is verified is the official socket moved and the staged proxy
published. Moves use Linux `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`, refusing to overwrite an
unexpected concurrent path. Missing kernel/libc support fails conservatively.

`/run/fnmusic-ext/ownership.json` is a 0600 atomic journal in a private directory.
It is written before takeover. It also enables recovery of the exact dead proxy
inode when no HTTP probe is possible. Normal stop, SIGTERM/SIGINT, child crashes,
and readiness failures stop/reap the child and verify official restoration.
`ExecStopPost` retries the same recovery after systemd termination. Automatic
restart is deliberately disabled to avoid repeated disruptive failed takeovers.

Exception classes, missing dependency names and stage/exit status are reported,
not arbitrary config values or response bodies. A small allowlist also preserves
child startup/shutdown messages, source/search/stream/auth/recommend failure
outcomes, known timeout/error categories, LLM HTTP status, timestamps/levels and
traceback module/function/line locations. Appended exception payloads, URLs,
credentials, full paths, configuration dumps and unrecognized messages are omitted;
configured secret values are removed before filtering. Oversized physical lines
are discarded in full. HTTP access logs remain disabled. This is deliberately
not a general-purpose redactor: new operational message formats need an allowlist
entry and a regression test. Preflight is not an OS sandbox: it isolates the current
application's known storage paths, not arbitrary future import side effects.

## Locks and ownership boundaries

* The outer installer `flock` serializes install/extend/restore. Its parent keeps
  the lock across install-to-extend chaining; file descriptors are closed in the
  invoked child. Root only prepares the stable lock inode; installer uid, HOME
  and environment remain those of the caller. Services never acquire this lock.
* A separate supervisor lifetime lock prevents duplicate supervisors.
* Short socket mutation locks protect the journal/moves. They are never held
  across `systemctl` or across service lifetime, avoiding installer/PID1 deadlocks.
* A proxy unit from another checkout is not stopped/overwritten. Container
  reconciliation/removal requires an exact Compose working-directory label;
  unknown/foreign containers are preserved. Source unit cleanup also checks the
  checkout's working directory. Host selected units are enabled then explicitly
  restarted; restart/readiness failures are errors, not successful installs.

## Conservative recovery limits

Unknown live sockets, symlinks/non-sockets, two official listeners, changed
recorded ownership, and unrecorded dead sockets are preserved and cause failure.
A legacy layout with an absent target and a positively identified official
upstream can be restored. Older proxies without the `/_ext/livez` endpoint are
correlated with the deployed unit BEFORE any stop: `restore-plan` matches the
socket's kernel peer against the unit's MainPID (or cgroup membership),
double-checks process start/executable and inode, and records the verified
listener with the proxy role. If that attribution fails, restore.sh refuses
before stopping anything, so a stop can no longer create an unrecoverable
layout. A reboot loses `/run` records; dead unrecorded sockets are never
guessed away.
SIGKILL of the supervisor relies on systemd killing the remaining child and
`ExecStopPost`; invoking the supervisor outside systemd does not provide that
external crash handler. Cooperative locks cannot fully serialize an unrelated
root process mutating the same paths. No-replace moves and repeated identity
checks reduce races; do not concurrently restart the official application during
installation or recovery.

On an ambiguous state, stop and investigate; do not manually remove socket paths
based solely on a successful business request. Failed verification does not print
“restore succeeded”. Changes to source services/configuration are not a complete
transactional rollback of an installation; rollback covers the socket takeover.

## Isolated validation

Run `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
proxy/tests/test_installation_reliability.py`. Tests use temporary UDS subprocesses,
including a temporary Python executable named `trim-music`, exact inode/process
checks, readiness delays, child SIGKILL, supervisor SIGTERM, startup exceptions,
and all seven nonempty source combinations in host/docker modes. Config imports
use the test interpreter and temporary storage (fixture project-Python paths point
to that interpreter, so CI does not skip coverage); lifecycle assertions use mocked
commands. They do not launch Docker or install/start units under host PID1.
Offline `systemd-analyze verify` checks unit syntax only, not real PID1 behavior.
A disposable fnOS/systemd VM is still required for end-to-end deployment validation.
